<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Jhonny. I am part strategist, part creator, part chaos-tamer.
  I'm the kind of person who treats challenges like puzzles, not problems, and refuses to settle for “good enough.” 
  My curiosity is borderline dangerous (in the best way), 
  and my brain has an annoying habit of connecting dots where most people don't even see lines.
</p>
<p>
  People say I'm equal parts ambitious and grounded: 
  ambitious because I don't believe in ceilings, 
  grounded because I know skyscrapers need deep foundations. 
  I thrive in high-pressure zones, 
  but I also know how to celebrate the little wins—because momentum is fuel.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not sharpening my edge with books, coding, or mental sparring, 
  you'll find me scheming my next big move, 
  cracking dry humor that lands 50% of the time (100% in my head), 
  or obsessing over how to be just 1% better every single day.
</p>
<p>
  In short I'm not here to blend in. 
  I'm here to build, disrupt, and leave footprints worth following.
</p>
